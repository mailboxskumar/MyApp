JXL library doesnot support  .csv and .xslx formats, which is the format used by Excel-2010. hence, use Excel 97-2003 which is .xls foramatted and is supported by JXL library. or else if you want to use excel-2010, use APACHE POI(XSSFWorkbooks) instead of JXL. For using .csv format, google for CSVReader libraries.

Re: HP ALM Trial version on Windows 10
In the same directory as the setup .exe file open the "validations.xml" for editing

Locate the following tag in the .xml file...

<os enabled="true"/>

Set the value to "false", for example...

<os enabled="false"/>

Save the xml file, run setup again
